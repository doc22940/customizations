bad configuration for i3 wm.

keybinds:

- mod is the windows key/command key
- switching screens: `mod+01234567890er`
- moving a window to a screen: `mod+shift+01234567890er`
- toggling floating on a window: `mod+shift+u`
- move focus: `mod+arrow keys`
- move windows: `mod+shift+arrow keys`
- launch programs with whiskermenu: `mod+space`
- open xfce4-terminal: `mod+enter`
- load layout: `mod+shift+l`
- take screenshot with flameshot: `mod+prntscrn`
- view a list of open windows: `alt+tab`
- disable borders on a window: `mod+shift+b` (some apps like firefox don't like borders. I would prefer it if borders were only visible when a window is active because borders look bad, but they're useful to help find out which windows are active)
- resize windows: `mod+right click drag`
- move floating windows: `mod+left click drag`
