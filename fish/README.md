configuration files for the fish shell

- `copy` and `paste` commands to copy to and paste from the xclip -selection clipboard.
- `ifconfig` replacement that shows only ip addresses. for all the information, use `ip addr` (arch linux) or the path to ifconfig on your system.
- press ctrl+c any time (even when you have not typed anything) and create a new line instead of just clearing the current command.

prompt theme and motd is managed by oh-my-fish. screenshot is using `omf t bobthefish` with Iosevka Custom Regular 9pt on xfce4-terminal.
